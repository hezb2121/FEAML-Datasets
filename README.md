# The Semantic Architect: How FEAML Bridges Structured Data and LLMs for Multi-Label Tasks

This repository contains the datasets used in our paper *“The Semantic Architect: How FEAML Bridges Structured Data and LLMs for Multi-Label Tasks”* (AAAI 2026).

All datasets are multi-label versions reconstructed from classic benchmarks (e.g., Adult, Bank, Student, Credit-G).  
They are used to evaluate the FEAML framework for automated, LLM-driven feature engineering.

Feel free to use these datasets for research and cite our paper if you find them helpful.
